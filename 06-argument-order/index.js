// Argument Order in Curried Functions

// Believe it or not, the order of arguments in curried functions makes a big
// difference in their usefulness. To understand, let's take a commonly used
// array method, Array.prototype.map(), and turn it into a curried function.
// You might be familiar with this implementation if you have used the
// Underscore or Lodash libraries.

const map = xs => fn => xs.map(fn)

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const double = num => num * 2

const arr1withMap = map(arr1)
const arr1Doubles = arr1withMap(double) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Our `map` function works, but the partially applied function it creates
// isn't very useful. It has data, but doesn't know what to do with it.
// It would be better if it knew what to do with the data, but was waiting
// to receive it. Then we could pass whatever data we would like to it. Let's
// change the argument order.

const map2 = fn => xs => xs.map(fn)

const listDoubler = map2(double)

listDoubler(arr1) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
listDoubler([3, 4, 8]) // [6, 8, 16]
listDoubler([1, -1, 0]) // [2, -2, 0]

// Now our partially applied function can be applied to any list of numbers
// which is very useful.

// When creating curried functions, a useful way to think about argument order
// is to place them in the order of most stable to least stable (left to
// right). Arguments that do not need to change such as a callback function
// like `double`, should come before instable arguments, such as data in the
// form of an array or object.

// Let's make a second example and drive this home. Let's make a function that
// picks a value out of an object based on a key.

const pick = key => obj => obj[key]
const pickName = pick('name')

const people = [
  { name: 'Kyle' },
  { name: 'Shirley' },
  { name: 'Kent' },
  { name: 'Sarah' },
  { name: 'Ken' }
]

const names = map2(pickName)(people) // ['Kyle', 'Shirley', 'Kent', 'Sarah', 'Ken']

// Imagine if pick's argument order was the other way. We couldn't pass it to
// the array's map method in a useful way because we'd have no way to declare
// what property name we want it to pick. By setting the argument order the
// way we did, our partially applied function worked beautifully, returning
// the name of each object we gave to it.
